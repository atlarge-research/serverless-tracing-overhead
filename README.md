# Investigating Performance Overhead of Distributed Tracing in Microservices and Serverless Systems

Author: **Anders NÃµu**

Folder `e1-request-based-experiment` contains all the instructions, code, and benchmarks to measure tracing overhead experiments for microservice. It is used for Figures 1 and 2 in the paper.

Folder `e2-infrastructure` sets up the Kubernetes infrastructrue for serverless experiments.

Folder `e3-task-based-experiments` has the code to measure overhead of serverless applications. It is used for Figure 3 of the paper.

Folder `e3-causes-of-overhead` has the code to identify the causes of overhead for both microservice and serverless applications. It is used for Figure 4 of the paper.
